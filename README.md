# JS-Project-4---Tic-Tac-Toe

TREEHOUSE TECHDEGREE FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT - PROJECT 4 - TIC TAC TOE

What the program does:

It runs a Tic Tac Toe game in which the user can play against the computer or against another player.
Players will add their names and take turns adding an X or O to the game board. The program keeps track of the state of the game - whose turn it is, where the X's and O's are on the board, and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.
